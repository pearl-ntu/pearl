# How to Add All Publications from Google Scholar

## ⚠️ Important: I Cannot Directly Scrape Google Scholar

Google Scholar has anti-scraping measures that prevent automated access. However, I can help you add all publications safely!

## ✅ Safe Method (Recommended)

### Option 1: Manual Copy-Paste (Safest)

1. **Go to the Google Scholar profile:**
   - https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=giWn_7cAAAAJ&hl=en

2. **Scroll through ALL pages** to load all publications
   - Click "Show more" or scroll to load everything
   - Make sure you see all publications

3. **Copy the publication list:**
   - You can copy-paste the text from the page
   - Or take screenshots
   - Or export if Google Scholar has an export feature

4. **Send me the list** and I'll format it properly and add it to `publications-data.js`

### Option 2: Use Google Scholar Export (If Available)

1. Check if Google Scholar has an "Export" or "BibTeX" option
2. Export all publications
3. Send me the exported file
4. I'll convert it to the correct format

### Option 3: Browser Extension

You can use browser extensions like:
- "Google Scholar Citations" 
- "Publish or Perish" (desktop app)

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ File structure is correct
- ✅ Fixed corrupted line
- ✅ Backup created (`publications-data.js.backup`)
- ✅ Currently has 2025 publications only

## 🔒 Safety Measures I've Taken

1. ✅ Created backup: `publications-data.js.backup`
2. ✅ Fixed corrupted line at top of file
3. ✅ Preserved all existing publications
4. ✅ Verified file structure is correct

## 📝 Format Needed

Each publication needs:
```javascript
{
    title: "Full Title",
    authors: "Author1, Author2, Author3, ...",
    journal: "Journal Name",
    year: 2024,
    citations: 25,
    url: "https://scholar.google.com/..."
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Please provide me with:**
1. The complete list of publications from Google Scholar, OR
2. An exported file if available, OR  
3. Tell me if you want to add them manually one by one

I'll then safely add them all to the file without breaking anything!
