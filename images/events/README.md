# Events Photos Directory

This directory contains photos for events.

## How to Add Event Photos:

1. **Prepare your photos:**
   - Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels (landscape)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Good quality photos work best

2. **Naming convention:**
   - Use lowercase letters and hyphens
   - Examples:
     - `lovelesh-phd-exam.jpg` - For Lovelesh's PhD qualifying exam event
     - `pearl-launch.jpg` - For PEARL launch event

3. **Add photos to this directory:**
   - Place the photo files directly in this `images/events/` folder
   - The website will automatically display them

4. **Photo will appear automatically:**
   - Once you add a photo with the correct filename, it will show on the Events page
   - If a photo is missing, it will be hidden (no broken image)

## Current Expected Photos:

- `lovelesh-phd-exam.jpg` - Lovelesh PhD Qualifying Exam event
- `pearl-launch.jpg` - PEARL Launch at NTU event
